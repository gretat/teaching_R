#Pipes feed into each other. Easiest interpretation is to read them as 'then'

####### Finding patterns with grepl and grep ######

genders <- c('male', 'female', 'non-binary', 'transgender', 'other')

# we want to find at which positions we can find the pattern male - i.e. male and female

ind<- grep('male', genders, fixed = T)

gender_cat <- genders[ind]

#or we can check whethere the two words are in with grepl

grepl('male', genders, fixed= T)

genders[grepl('male', genders, fixed= T)] #gives you male and female immediately

#these two functions are sometimes very useeful when trying to filter instances 



######## Advanced Variable creation with mutate #######

#create a new variable based on a conditional statement 
# ifelse(conditon, case_if_true, case_if_false)

employments_mutate <- employment_separate %>% 
  mutate(numbered_gender = ifelse(Gender == 'Male', 1, ifelse(Gender == 'Female', 2, 0)))

employment_mutate_cases <- employments_mutate %>% 
  mutate(Carrots_eaten = case_when(married_percentage <= 60 ~ 40, married_percentage > 60 & Value<= 4000 ~ 3450, Value > 4000 ~ 6000))  # I have created a random carrots eating variable for illustration purposes
  


# or we can change more than one variable based on the same rule
employment_mutate_at <- employment_mutate_cases %>% 
  mutate_at(vars('Carrots_eaten', 'Value'),  sqrt ) 






############## Advanced filtering  #######


#filter based on more than one matching condition using %in%

employment_females <- employment_mutate_cases %>% 
  filter(Gender %in% c('Male', 'Female')) # or put ! before Gender to get everything that is not Male or Female
#or filter(tolower(Gender) %in% gender_cat)

# we can specify which columns we want to filter at if we want to perform the same
# operation on more than one occasion

employment_filter_at <- employment_mutate_cases %>% 
  filter_at(vars('Carrots_eaten', 'Value'),  ~ . >2000 ) 
#We are keeping only those instances that are larger than 2000 both in carrots_eaten and Value


#Filter_if

# we can also do conditional filtering and mutations
# say you want to  only look at the ones 
employment_filter_if <- employment_mutate_cases %>% 
  filter_if(is.numeric,   all_vars( . < 6000)) #we only want to keep those instances that have a value smaller than 6000 in all numeric columns


#Filter_all
#sometimes you want to filter all of or variables at the same time 
employment_filter_all <- employment_mutate_cases %>% 
  mutate(Royalty = case_when(Gender == 'Female' ~ 'Q1', Gender == 'Male' ~ 'K1', Gender == 'All' ~ 'R1')) %>% 
  filter_all(any_vars(grepl(pattern ='Q1', ., fixed = TRUE))) #any row that is either first quarter or Q1 in royalty




############Joining tables #######


#we can join tables with the same column titles 

employment1<- employment[1:400,]
employment2 <- employment[600 :1200,]

employment_rbind <- rbind(employment1, employment2)



# or we can join based on same number of rows

emplyment_cbind <- cbind(employment1, employment2[1:400,])



### more useful is if we want to join tables we already have
####extra 2 joins: 

#create a lookup table just for ilustration purposes

#func_join(table1, table2, by = common_variables)
#inner_join -  keep only rows that match
#left_join - keep all from table 1, only matching rows in table2
# right_join - keep all from table 2, only matching rows in table 1
# anti_join - keep only rows in table 1 that do not have a match in table 2
# full_join - keep everything 


#we can

to_join <- tibble(married_perc = sort(unique(employment_mutate_cases$married_percentage)), rate_average = rep(c('bellow', 'above'), each = 2))

#join using 
joined_tables <- inner_join(employment_mutate_cases, to_join, by = c('married_percentage' = 'married_perc'))


########## Plotting opportunities #######
